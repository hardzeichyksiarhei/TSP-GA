Genetic Algorithm implementation by Evan Conrad and Sebastian Vargas
pmx.py and cx.py are the PMX and cycle crossover file implementations respectively.


Set the parameters for the GA by editing params.json
To run our genetic algorithms with the PMX/Cycle crossover mating with
either tournament or topdown pairing, run main.py.
